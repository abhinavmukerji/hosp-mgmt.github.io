				<p>Into whatsoever houses we enter, we will enter to help the sick,

                           	especially from abusing the bodies of man or woman, bond or free. 
                           	And whatsoever we shall see or hear in the course of my profession,
	                   	as well as outside my profession in our intercourse with men, if it 
                           	be what should not be published abroad, we will never divulge,
                           	holding such things to be holy secrets.</p>
